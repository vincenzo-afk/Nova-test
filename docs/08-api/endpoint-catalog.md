# Endpoint Catalog

## Purpose

The literal, enumerated method+path list for every REST endpoint in the
categories `rest-api.md` describes — that document covers categories and
conventions; this one is the concrete catalog an SDK or integration
would actually be generated from, the same role `docs/26-system-reference/
06-error-catalog.md` and `07-event-catalog.md` play for their respective
domains.

## Scope

Method, path, and one-line purpose per endpoint. Request/response body
shapes are `docs/08-api/schemas.md`; authentication is `docs/08-api/
sdk.md`'s trust model; pagination behavior for list endpoints is
`pagination.md`.

## Adding a new endpoint

Same discipline as `docs/26-system-reference/06-error-catalog.md`'s code
allocation: a new endpoint gets a row here in the same change that
implements it, with its category matching one already described in
`rest-api.md` (or a new category added to both files together, never one
without the other).
