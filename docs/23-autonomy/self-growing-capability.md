# Self-Growing Capability

## Purpose

Specifies the general principle behind
`autonomous-plugin-discovery.md` and `automatic-software-installation.md`:
NOVA's capability surface is designed to grow at runtime in response to
what the user needs, rather than being fixed at build time — "need
feature → NOVA builds capability → uses it forever."

## Scope

This document is the unifying policy statement; the concrete mechanisms
are the two documents above plus a third path — generated tool
composition — specified here.

## Three growth mechanisms

1. **Install an existing plugin/MCP server** —
   `autonomous-plugin-discovery.md`, for capabilities the ecosystem
   already provides.
2. **Install existing third-party software** —
   `automatic-software-installation.md`, for capabilities that require an
   external application rather than a NOVA plugin.
3. **Compose a new tool from existing primitives** — where a repeated
   user need has no existing plugin or application (e.g., "always
   summarize my inbox this specific way every Monday"), NOVA may generate
   a saved, named **Composite Tool**: a fixed sequence or small script
   built entirely from already-permitted tool calls
   (`docs/06-tools/tool-registry.md`), registered as a first-class tool
   for reuse. A Composite Tool is not arbitrary generated code executed
   outside the sandbox — it is a saved plan through already-approved
   tools, reviewable and deletable like any saved automation, and it
   inherits the permission scope of the tools it composes rather than
   gaining new privileges by being saved.

## "Uses it forever"

Once installed or composed, a capability persists in the Capability
Registry / Tool Registry across restarts exactly like any other
configured provider or plugin — there is no separate "temporary
capability" tier that evaporates. It appears in Settings alongside
manually installed items, editable and removable the same way.

## Boundary: what does not grow

- **The knowledge graph ontology remains fixed and versioned**
  (`docs/04-memory/ontology.md`) — self-growing capability is scoped to
  the tool/plugin/provider surface, not to NOVA inventing new memory
  schema at runtime. This boundary is restated explicitly because it is
  the one item `docs/15-decisions/adr-0008-v5-architecture-evolution.md`
  did not repeal.
- **No capability grows its own permission scope.** A Composite Tool, an
  installed plugin, or an installed application only ever operates within
  permissions the user has explicitly granted to its constituent actions.
- **Every growth path passes through an explicit approval step** —
  discovery and composition can happen autonomously; installation and
  first use of a materially new permission scope cannot.
